      <description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago, building your own programming language is something crazy. We have
very limited resource on what to do. Almost everything has to be done in C.
Nowaday, the world we live in is different. Lots of people roll their own
language, their own OS, their own database. I think the reason is the tooling
is way better, the knowledge is more accessible than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m always dreaming about creating my own programming language. But the time
it takes to write the whole eco system, standard library is very long. I look
outside and realize people try to leverage an existing eco system, like Elixir
was built on top of ErlangVM, or Clojure run on JVM. I think I can take this
idea, and build something similar for Go lang. I like FP and Lisp, so I decided
to create Mochi Lang, a Lisp for Go.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mochi Lang is a Lisp dialect, trying to follow Clojure syntax,
            that compiled down to Go lang. At this point, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t looks like
            Clojure yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t a language on its own, It&amp;rsquo;s a frontend for Go lang, at the bottom
level, Go lang is invoked to compile your code.&lt;/p&gt;
